# hello-world
Does github run scripts?

Okay, the guide at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ 

told me to "make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits"

This is the only file present in this location, so I am making changes to it.  

Now I must figure out how to "push" these changes as commits.

(Okay, successful, but I wonder why they didn't just say "Click the "commit changes" button?)
